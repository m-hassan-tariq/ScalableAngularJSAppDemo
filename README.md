# ScalableAngularJSAppDemo
Food for thought: Please go through code in VS, Its a sample angular application, doesn't have that much of meat in it, 
a skeleton app which deals functionality like: 

- Directory Structure
- File Naming Convention
- Angular UI routing
- Angular UI Bootstrap 3 (Nothing that much has been done in terms of styling and look)
- Dependency Injection for each module (onBoardingApp.candidate.js file)
- Routing for each module (onBoardingApp.candidate.js file)
- For scalability using Controller AS feature for $scope replacement (Please check onBoardingApp.candidate.controller.js and onBoardingApp.candidate file) 
- Sample test factory (onBoardingApp.candidate.services.js file)
